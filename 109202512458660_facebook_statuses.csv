Haeata is a part-Maori from Fukuoka, Japan, who has been working in the Guides Department. After he graduates from BYU-Hawaii this semester in marketing, he will begin working for a large U.S. pharmaceutical company in Kobe, Japan.

Ligaliga, a Samoan from Auckland, New Zealand, has worked in the Guides Department and the Māori Village. After he also graduates this semester from BYUH with a degree in social work, he and his young family will return to Auckland where he plans to go to law school.

President Grace praised both of the young men and explained that the annual award ""is the highest acknowledgement extended to a student employee,"" and that it honors the late Barbara Velasco, who own aloha spirit was instrumental in fundraising for the PCC and BYU-Hawaii. A generous donation from Keith B. and Carol Jenkins made the financial part of the award possible.

Originally scheduled for the Tongan Village, the PCC moved the MPHS event into the theater when rain threatened — which was just as well, since over 500 people attended.

This year's MPHS conference focuses on the formal centennial of the Mormon Church's mission in Tonga. Elder Groberg, who served there as a young missionary from 1954-1957, wrote an autobiography (""In the Eye of the Storm"") of his experiences there, which was later made into the movie ""The Other Side of Heaven.""

Elder Groberg returned to Tonga as a mission president and in other Latter-day Saint leadership roles many times over the past 60 years. He and his wife, Jean, answered questions about their lives in Tonga following his address.

Lotomau, a Samoan from Australia (originally from New Zealand), graduated from BYU–Hawaii on Monday (Nov. 2, 2015) and reports  next week to his new job in the front office of a Marriott hotel on the Gold Coast near Brisbane.

Keith and Carol Jenkins, friends of BYU–Hawaii and the Polynesian Cultural Center, endowed this award in memory of the late ""Aunty"" Barbara Velasco who worked with philanthropic donors to the two institutions and personified the aloha spirit. The PCC presents the award each year to a senior student employee who demonstrates the same spirit of aloha exemplified in the life of the late Aunty Barbara.

For example, Lotomau ""championed"" a get-well video that the PCC sent a couple of years ago to an 11-year-old boy who was going through degenerative heart disease surgery and, therefore, couldn't come in person to the PCC.

PCC Guides Services Manager Jimmy Mapu said when Lotomau's on duty, he ""never had to worry, second-guess or fear for their team's experience, their customers' expectations, or the quality of their work. He leads by example and handles any situation that comes his way.""

Kalili, a large Hawaiian from Laie, lost three fingers of his right hand in an industrial accident. His subsequent wave — while portraying King Kamehameha in the old Laie Hukilau, with the little finger-and-thumb extended — has since spread around the world and is now known as the ""shaka"" sign.

""Before I signed the contract, I thought about it for a whole week, and I said to myself, I’m not sure it can be done,"" he said. ""However, it came together easier and faster than I ever thought that it would. Even now that it’s finished, I can hardly believe how quickly and how well it turned out.”

Transfield has also completed a sculpture of Joseph Kekuku, another Hawaiian native of Laie, who invented the unique Hawaiian steel guitar. That statue will be put on display as part of a planned new ukulele factory at the Polynesian Cultural Center.

The open kitchen's centerpiece wood-burning brick oven will also bake delicious pizzas; and much more.

She said ever since she can remember, she was learning how to dance on her mom’s lap. To her tamure is her second nature, part of DNA and also part of the identity that brings a sense of belonging and familiarity.

This event Tamure Marathon is for anyone to feel happy through enjoyment, fitness and also socializing that come from dancing together.

Original Post:
Donna and her husband visited Polynesian Cultural Center (PCC) back in 1991 (23 years ago) and when they bought a souvenir at one of the shops, received this $5 bill as part of their change. It has a Deposit stamp to Bank of Hawaii with the Polynesian Cultural Center name (look closely at the last two lines of the red stamp). They thought that was a fun little thing that would remind them of the great time they had here, so for all these years, they kept the bill and promised each other that they would someday return to their personal paradise here in Hawaii and the PCC. Sadly, a few years ago her husband fell ill and passed away. Donna decided that she would fulfill her promise, albeit alone, to return to Hawaii. She came to the Center, handed us this bill and said, ""The PCC is a paradise to us so returning this bill to the PCC makes me feel like I'm returning my husband's soul to dwell here in this paradise forever!""

“I know that we all look back on this place with love, great gratitude and fondness, because in our lives, many of the most important we have done happened in this place: For many of us, we gained an education here. We also fell in love. We married in the House of the Lord. We gave birth to our first children. I can’t tell you how many people have come back and said, my first child was born here. These are lifetime memories that will continue to make this place sacred for us.”

President Grace also encouraged all alumni to make sure we do our part to ensure that those who come after us at the Cultural Center will continue to receive and enjoy the same blessings.  

“Know that we love and appreciate every one of you, and know that you will always be welcome here.”

As the PCC's popularity grew, the schedule first expanded to Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday . . . and then to nightly performances (closed on Sundays) by the late 1960s. At that point the Center also expanded the capacity of the theater, and sometimes put on ""double shows"" to satisfy demand.
