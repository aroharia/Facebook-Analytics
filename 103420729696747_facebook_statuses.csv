You want dancing? There’s dancing. You want singing? There’s singing. You want Ajay Patel? Good luck hearing him over the volume level of his emcee partner Sonya Joshi.        

The primary purpose of the show is to raise awareness and funds for The World Race, a program which one of our beloved alumni, Jayshree Thomas, will be participating in next year. The World Race is an 11 month mission trip that extends into 11 different countries to serve underprivileged communities. You can find out more information about her trip at: http://jayshreethomas.theworldrace.org. 

Texas Mohini is proud to support Jayshree in her noble journey to help those less fortunate. We are so excited to share our love for dance and for her mission. This event will showcase all the different styles of dance that Mohini incorporates. These styles will be featured in small and large group performances. Apart from the dancing, we have extremely talented guest singing acts that you will not want to miss! 

Doors open at 6:30 PM and the show will begin promptly at 7 PM. Tickets are $10 per person, and can be purchased here: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/texas-mohini-spring-2015-benefit-show-tickets-16671661388

(Donations are also more than welcome, and there will be an opportunity to give on the ticket page and at the show as well).      

We have had an extremely rewarding season, and could not think of a better way to end it than giving back for such a great cause! Thank you Jayshree Thomas for allowing us to be a part of your road to this amazing journey!

Thank you to everyone who put together this show, it was meticulously organized and you guys have got to be the friendliest people we've ever met in our lives. Especially a huge shout out to our liaisons Hiral, Sajan and Reeba who became part of our Mohini family this weekend, thank you for being so selfless the entire weekend and showing us an amazing time.

And congrats to UC Dhadak International Dance Team, SLU Shakti, and especially our very own Punjabbawockeez for their flawless performances and respective placings. Words can't describe how proud of you boys we are and how much more amazing the whole experience was because we got to share it with such a fun group of gentlemen :) 

Dancing to raise awareness about the injustices of human trafficking was an experience that we will never forget.
