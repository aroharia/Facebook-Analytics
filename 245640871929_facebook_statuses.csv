Dear UT Community, 

University officials continue to monitor the weather and travel conditions as Hurricane Harvey, now a Category 4 hurricane, makes landfall and approaches Central Texas.

We are collaborating with the City of Austin and state emergency agencies and will provide updates throughout the weekend on weather and safety issues via text (for urgent matters) and email, and through traditional and social media.

Mooov-In continues, and nearly 5,000 residents had checked in to residence halls as of 7 p.m. Students who arrive on campus have been directed to check in at their residence halls instead of going to UFCU Disch-Falk Field, where the main Mooov-In event had been taking place.

As we indicated in our previous email to the campus community, students and families planning to come to campus during the weekend should put their safety first when making travel decisions. For those students who are unable to get to campus in time for class because of the weather, we will work to accommodate their needs in residence halls and classrooms.

As a reminder, for up-to-the-minute information, anyone can sign up for text updates by texting to the keyword UTMOVE to 888-777. These text updates are specifically for information this weekend and are offered in addition to the universityâ€™s urgent alert system, which is always in effect.

â€”â€”â€”â€” ORIGINAL POST â€”â€”â€”â€” 

As Hurricane Harvey moves across Texas and approaches Austin, the university is monitoring the weather and travel conditions, working to ensure the safety of all of our students, employees and visitors and assessing whether any changes are required in university functions or schedules.

University officials are speaking regularly with the City of Austin and state emergency agencies to prepare for the effects of the hurricane. The university will provide updates throughout the weekend on any weather and safety issues via text (for urgent matters) and email, through traditional and social media, and on this site (https://emergency.utexas.edu/).

TEXT UPDATES

The university is making information about the weather and its impact on students, university operations and Mooov-In available throughout the weekend via text updates.

For up-to-the-minute information, anyone can sign up for text updates by texting to the keyword UTMOVE to 888-777. A response message will be sent back immediately.

These text updates are specifically for information this weekend and are in addition to the universityâ€™s urgent alert system which is always in effect.

SOCIAL MEDIA UPDATES

The university will provide updates over the weekend via the following social media channels.

PARKING

To help the campus community protect their assets, Parking and Transportation Services (PTS) is doing the following:

1. Opening all garage entrances and exits at 5 p.m. this afternoon (Friday, August 25), with the exception of the Conference Center and Health Center Garages. 
- Students are encouraged to park in garages instead of on the street or in open lots.
- Garages will be open at no charge through 10 am on Monday, August 28th. Vehicles that parked in the garages must be out by that time to avoid parking fees.
- It is recommended that vehicles are parked on levels 2 or higher.

2. Recommending during this weather system that campus avoid parking on San Jacinto Boulevard, 24th Street, and 21st Street near Waller Creek as these areas can be affected by flash flooding

3. Raising and locking west elevators of San Jacinto Garage and the SE elevator at Trinity Garage on a higher floor to prevent cabs entering a flooded area starting at 4:45 pm today (8/25/17). 

If the situation changes with Hurricane Harvey and parking, PTS will send out notification if the above action plan is extended. 

MOOOV-IN

Mooov-In has accelerated and many students have already checked in to their residence halls, some ahead of schedule. Two-thirds of residents are expected to be checked in by tonight (8/25/17).

Centralized check in for Mooov-In on Saturday, August 26 will no longer be at UFCU Disch-Falk Field. Students and their families will check in at various residence hall locations.

Creekside is the only residence hall that could be threatened due to flooding and could possibly be evacuated if conditions warrant. Contingency plans are in place to move those students to supplemental housing and lounges at residence halls if necessary.

If flooding happened at San Jacinto Residence Hall, it would only affect the first floor which has meeting rooms and food service. Residents would not have to change location.

Students and families planning to come to campus today or over the next few days should put their own safety first when making travel decisions. For those students who are unable to get to campus in time for class because of the weather, the university will work to accommodate their needs both in the residence halls and in the classroom and will provide further information as we approach Wednesdayâ€™s start of the academic year.

The Mooov-In website will continue to be updated with new information for students and their families: http://housing.utexas.edu/future/mooov-in-before-arrive

Dear UT Community:

Tonight, I write to you with a very heavy heart.

As I wrote earlier, there was a horrific act of violence that took place at the center of our campus this afternoon. Four UT students were attacked. One student was killed and three other students sustained injuries. University officials have reached out to their families to provide support. Two of the victims have since been released from the hospital.

A suspect, who is also a UT student, was apprehended within minutes of the attack and is in police custody.

I ask that our entire community come together to support the victims and their families. They are suffering, and we all must be there for them. Preparations are underway for a gathering to honor the victims that will be held in the coming days.

There is a great deal of fear on campus and in our community. That fear is very understandable, especially in light of recent vandalism and threats against students. Like you, we are following the rumors and reports circulating on social media. The UT Police Department, the Austin Police Department and the Texas Department of Public Safety are continuing to investigate all reports and do not believe that there are any further threats at this time. As a precaution, law enforcement agencies â€” UTPD, APD and DPS â€” have increased patrols on campus and west of campus. As always, if you see anything suspicious please call 911.  

Many students and parents are frustrated with how long the university took to notify them of todayâ€™s attack. I understand those frustrations, and I am committed to faster notification in the future.

Classes and events will be held tomorrow. And I know that it will be a very difficult day for everyone on the Forty Acres, so please, be there for one another. The UT Counseling and Mental Health Center has extended its hours from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. through Wednesday. For more information about student support services, click here (https://news.utexas.edu/resources-for-campus-community) 

Once again, please keep your thoughts and prayers with the victims and their families during this very difficult time.

Sincerely,

Gregory L. Fenves
President

Update 6:55 p.m. â€” From The University of Texas at Austin Police Department (UTPD): 

As UTPD continues to investigate today's stabbing, we want to reiterate that we do not know of any additional or ongoing threats on or near UT campus.

We continue to work closely with the Austin Police Department and the Texas Department of Public Safety to further investigate any rumors. Thus far, we have not found any of the incidents to be credible.

As an additional precaution, we have increased police patrols on campus tonight alongside both DPS and APD. These law enforcement partners have also increased patrols west of campus.

In addition, UT shuttle buses will remain in operation until 11:00 pm this evening and SUREWALK is providing transport. To use SUREWALK, call 512-232-9255 or orderasurewalk@gmail.com.

++++++++++

Update 5:30 p.m. â€” From Austin Police Department: 

Lots of rumors swirling around. Unless you hear from an official source, there are no further threats on or off UT Austin's campus at this time.

++++++++++

Update 4 p.m. â€” Here's a message from President Fenves: 

Dear UT Community,

This afternoon, there was an attack involving multiple stabbings, which led to one death and three other victims who were seriously injured. A suspect has been apprehended and is in custody. UTPD and campus security continue to evaluate the situation and at this time we do not believe there is an ongoing threat.

Due to this horrific and senseless tragedy in the heart of our campus, we are canceling all classes and scheduled events for the rest of the afternoon and evening. A number of buildings are closed or have limited access because of the ongoing investigation.

I encourage all students, staff and faculty to follow UTPD on Twitter for updates as the investigation progresses, and we will update you as more information becomes available.  Please find community among your peers and help each other. Counseling and support services are available in the Student Activity Center or by calling 512-475-6628.

There are no words to describe my sense of loss. Campus safety is our highest priority and we will investigate this tragic incident to the greatest extent possible. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families, the witnesses to the crime, and every member of Longhorn nation. We all mourn today.  

Sincerely,

Greg Fenves
President

++++++++++

Update 3:30 p.m.: 

Due to the violent attack on campus this afternoon and limited access to some buildings because of investigation, we are cancelling classes and events for the remainder of the afternoon and evening.

There is currently no ongoing threat on campus.
We are in the process of collecting more information. For safety alerts and updates, please follow UTPD on Twitter. You can expect additional information as we have it.

In the early 1930s the Regents of The University of Texas hired Paul Philippe Cret (1876-1945) as the university's supervising architect and commissioned him to draw up a general plan for the campus. Of Cretâ€™s multiple proposed designs the Regents chose a large, Mediterranean-influenced Beaux-Arts building topped by a 31-story tower. The great tower, the only structure that competed with the dome of the State Capitol on the Austin skyline, became the centerpiece of the campus and formed, in Cret's words, ""the image carried in our memory when we think of the place.""

The Showband of the Southwestâ€™s first full-time director passed away late Tuesday. DiNino, known to many as â€œMr. Dâ€ù, arrived at the university in 1955. He was Director of the Longhorn Band from 1955-1975 and Director of University Bands from 1969 until his retirement in 1985. During his time as director, he took the an all-male, all-white band and fully integrated the band, opening it to all students.  

Big Bertha, the â€œSweetheart of the Longhorn Band,â€ù arrived during his first year at UT. DiNino is known for March Grandioso, a trademark fight song that was introduced in 1955, and later for Wabash Cannonball. Originally introduced in 1970, Wabash Cannonball was Coach Darrel K Royalâ€™s favorite tune, and so DiNino had the band play it between the third and fourth quarters of every football game as a salute to Coach Royal who had just won his third national championship. Mr. D also chose the bandâ€™s famous cowboy-style uniforms.

Youâ€™ll get a little bit of history, a little bit of insight, and a lot of firsthand views of campus buildings, common areas, and art and architecture.

In 1839 the Congress of the Republic of Texas ordered that a site be set aside to meet the stateâ€™s higher education needs. Some 40 years later the state legislature called for the establishment of â€œa university of the first classâ€ù that would be located in Austin. 

In November of 1882, construction began on the original Main Building, and less than one year later, on Sept. 15, 1883, the university was opened with one building, six schools, a law department, eight professors, a proctor and 221 students. Today, the university is home to about 51,000 students, 17 colleges and schools, more than 100 undergraduate and 170 graduate degree programs, and more than 3,000 faculty. 

The universityâ€™s main campus began on forty acres set aside on College Hill when Austin became the state capital. Today the main campus covers more than 350 acres, but many people refer to it as â€œthe Forty Acres.â€ù This Self-Guided Tour offers you a personal view of the Forty Acres. Youâ€™ll get a little bit of history, a little bit of insight, and a lot of firsthand views of campus buildings, common areas, and art and architecture.
