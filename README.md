# Facebook-Analytics
## Fetch &amp; Analyze any Facebook Page
Large amounts of Facebook data go unused due to the difficulty of collecting and analyzing the data. Our website analyzes and visualizes data from user-requested Facebook pages. This allows users to enhance their Facebook experience. Users can see what type of posts gain more popularity and advertisers can use data to improve the effectiveness of their ads.

## Analytics
